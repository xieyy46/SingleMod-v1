# SingleMod
![schematic illustration of SingleMod](Figures/schematic illustration.png)
A deep learning model designed for the precise detection of m6A within single RNA molecules using nanopore DRS data. SingleMod is trained through a deep multiple instance regression framework, carefully tailored to harness the extensive methylation-rate labels. SingleMod is a generizable framework which can be easily adopted to train model for other Nucleic Acid Modifications.
